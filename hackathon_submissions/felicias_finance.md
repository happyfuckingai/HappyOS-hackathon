# Felicia's Finance ‚Äî AWS AI Agent Hackathon Submission

## üåü Inspiration

Felicia's Finance was born from a bold vision: What if we could build a secure, intelligent bridge between the stable world of traditional finance and the dynamic realm of decentralized finance ‚Äî entirely on AWS?

The inspiration came from witnessing the artificial divide between TradFi and DeFi. Traditional banking offers security and compliance but lacks innovation. DeFi offers innovation and yield opportunities but lacks security and regulatory compliance. We asked: Why choose sides when you can unite both worlds?

Named "Felicia" after the AI agent that serves as your personal financial partner, this system represents the future of **Hybrid Finance (HyFi)** ‚Äî where AWS-native intelligence orchestrates seamless interactions between traditional banking and Web3 ecosystems.
