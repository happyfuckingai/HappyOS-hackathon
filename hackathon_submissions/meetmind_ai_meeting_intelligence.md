# MeetMind AI Meeting Intelligence ‚Äî AWS AI Agent Hackathon Submission

## üåü Inspiration

MeetMind was born from necessity ‚Äî built alone, on AWS, against the odds. While preparing for my AWS Startup Solutions Architect application, I saw a huge need: meetings generate hours of conversation but lose critical insights.

The inspiration deepened during a period when I was, ironically, declared legally dead by the Swedish Tax Agency. Even when systems failed me, I kept building. MeetMind became proof that even when bureaucracy breaks down, builders keep creating intelligent solutions.

I built MeetMind to transform meetings into actionable intelligence using AWS Bedrock and real-time AI ‚Äî designed as if it were an AWS-native product ready for enterprise deployment.

## üí° What It Does

**MeetMind** is a secure AI meeting-intelligence system that operates as an isolated MCP server within the HappyOS ecosystem. It listens to real-time conversations, understands context, and delivers intelligent summaries, action items, and decisions ‚Äî all within a zero-trust, enterprise-grade architecture.

            "ingest_result", "generate_meeting_summary",
            "extract_action_items", "analyze_decisions"
        ]
    
    async def ingest_result(self, partial_result):
        """Receive partial results from other agents"""
        await self.combine_insights(partial_result)
        return await self.generate_comprehensive_summary()
    
    async def generate_meeting_summary(self, meeting_context):
        """Generate AI-powered meeting summary"""
        return await self.bedrock_client.summarize_meeting(
            meeting_context,
            include_actions=True,
            include_decisions=True
        )
```

**LiveKit Agent Integration:**
```python
class LiveKitMeetingAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.transcribe_client = boto3.client('transcribe')
        self.bedrock_client = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
    
    async def process_audio_stream(self, audio_stream):
        """Process real-time audio for meeting intelligence"""
        transcript = await self.transcribe_client.start_stream_transcription(
            audio_stream,
            language_code='sv-SE'  # Swedish support
        )
        return await self.extract_insights(transcript)
```

### Multi-Agent Communication Flow:
