# HappyOS SDK Enterprise Restructure - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The HappyOS SDK is an enterprise-grade software development kit for building industry-specific AI agent systems. Currently structured as a flat directory, it lacks the professional packaging standards expected of enterprise SDKs like OpenAI's or Google's SDKs. This specification defines the restructuring into a production-ready, pip-installable package with enterprise-grade organization, documentation, and developer experience.

## Vision Statement

Create a world-class SDK that enables developers to build sophisticated, industry-specific AI agent systems with the same ease and professionalism as using OpenAI or Google Cloud SDKs, while maintaining complete isolation and MCP-based communication patterns.

## Glossary

- **HappyOS_SDK**: Enterprise software development kit for building industry-specific AI agent systems on the HappyOS platform
- **Agent_System**: Complete AI agent implementation including MCP servers, business logic, and industry-specific workflows
- **MCP_Protocol**: Model Context Protocol for secure agent-to-agent communication
- **Industry_Vertical**: Specific business domains (finance, healthcare, manufacturing, etc.) with specialized agent requirements
- **Enterprise_Package**: Professional Python package with comprehensive documentation, testing, and CI/CD
- **Developer_Experience**: The complete workflow from installation to production deployment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install the HappyOS SDK via pip, so that I can easily integrate it into my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `pip install happyos-sdk`, THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL be installed from PyPI or a local package
2. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include a proper setup.py file with package metadata and dependencies
3. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include a pyproject.toml file following modern Python packaging standards
4. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL be importable as `import happyos_sdk` after installation
5. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing import statements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SDK organized into logical submodules, so that I can easily find and import specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Package_Structure SHALL organize modules into logical subpackages (communication, observability, security, resilience, services)
2. THE Package_Structure SHALL maintain a clean root __init__.py that exposes the public API
3. WHEN a developer imports from happyos_sdk, THE Package_Structure SHALL provide access to all public classes and functions
4. THE Package_Structure SHALL separate core functionality from utilities and examples
5. THE Package_Structure SHALL include proper __init__.py files in all subpackages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can understand how to use the SDK effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include a comprehensive README.md with installation and usage instructions
2. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include example code demonstrating common usage patterns
3. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include API documentation for all public interfaces
4. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include migration guides for existing users
5. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include version information and changelog

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want proper testing and CI/CD setup, so that I can ensure SDK quality and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include a comprehensive test suite covering all modules
2. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include pytest configuration for running tests
3. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include GitHub Actions workflows for testing and publishing
4. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include code quality tools (black, flake8, mypy)
5. THE HappyOS_SDK SHALL include coverage reporting and quality gates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want minimal and focused modules, so that I can import only what I need without unnecessary dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Submodules SHALL be organized by functionality with minimal interdependencies
2. THE Submodules SHALL allow selective importing of specific components
3. THE Submodules SHALL have clear separation between core and optional functionality
4. THE Submodules SHALL minimize external dependencies where possible
5. THE Submodules SHALL provide lazy loading for heavy dependencies
