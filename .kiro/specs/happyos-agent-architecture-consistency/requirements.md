# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines requirements for ensuring architectural consistency across all three HappyOS agent systems (Agent Svea, Felicia's Finance, and MeetMind) by refactoring existing agents to use the complete HappyOS SDK exclusively. 

**Based on comprehensive analysis (see `.analysis/00_inventory.md` and `happyos_sdk/INVENTORY.md`):**
- ✅ **HappyOS SDK is fully implemented and ready for adoption**
- ❌ **All agents currently violate isolation with backend.* imports** 
- ✅ **Backend Core A2A infrastructure is complete and should be preserved**
- ❌ **Agent refactoring is the primary work needed, not new development**

The goal is to eliminate isolation violations and ensure all systems follow the same communication patterns using the existing, complete HappyOS SDK.

## Glossary

- **Backend_Core_A2A**: Internal backend communication protocol (`backend/core/a2a/`) used ONLY for backend-internal services
- **HappyOS_SDK**: Complete interface layer (`happyos_sdk/`) that translates between MCP and A2A protocols for isolated agent servers - **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR ADOPTION**
- **Global_A2A_Protocol**: The unified Agent-to-Agent protocol where MCP servers use HappyOS SDK to communicate with backend via A2A
- **MCP_Server_Isolation**: Complete isolation of agent servers with zero backend.* imports, using ONLY HappyOS SDK
- **Reply_To_Semantics**: Async callback mechanism where agents ACK immediately then send results via MCP protocol
- **Communications_Agent**: Central orchestrator using LiveKit + Google Realtime that initiates MCP workflows via HappyOS SDK
- **MCP_UI_Hub**: Backend service that routes results between agents and frontend using Backend_Core_A2A internally
- **Fan_In_Logic**: MeetMind's capability to collect partial results from multiple agents via MCP and combine them
- **Circuit_Breaker_Pattern**: AWS service failover implemented in HappyOS SDK with automatic fallback to local implementations
- **Signed_MCP_Headers**: Authentication mechanism using HMAC/Ed25519 for secure agent communication via HappyOS SDK
- **Tenant_Isolation**: Multi-tenant security enforced via MCP headers with tenant-id validation in HappyOS SDK

## Requirements

### Requirement 1
