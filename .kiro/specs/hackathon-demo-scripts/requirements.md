# Requirements Document - Hackathon Demo Scripts

## Introduction

Create four distinct demo video scripts for NotebookLM for four separate AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon submissions: MeetMind, Felicia's Finance, Agent Svea, and Happy OS. Each script must demonstrate compliance with hackathon requirements while showcasing each project as an independent AI agent solution.

## Glossary

- **Happy OS**: Self-healing multi-agent operating system with MCP architecture
- **MCP Protocol**: Model Context Protocol for agent-to-agent communication
- **Agent Svea**: Swedish ERP and compliance agent module
- **Felicia's Finance**: Financial services and crypto trading agent
- **MeetMind**: Meeting intelligence agent with fan-in logic
- **Communications Agent**: Orchestration layer using LiveKit + Google Realtime
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience pattern for automatic failover
- **A2A Protocol**: Agent-to-Agent communication via MCP with reply-to semantics
- **Fan-In Logic**: Collecting partial results from multiple agents
- **AWS Bedrock**: Amazon's managed foundation model service
- **LiveKit**: Real-time video/audio communication platform

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hackathon Compliance Coverage

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see clear evidence that Happy OS meets all technical requirements, so that I can properly evaluate the submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any demo script, THE Demo SHALL demonstrate usage of AWS Bedrock or Amazon SageMaker AI for LLM hosting
2. WHEN showcasing agent capabilities, THE Demo SHALL show autonomous decision-making with reasoning LLMs
3. WHEN demonstrating integrations, THE Demo SHALL show API connections, database access, and external tool usage
4. WHERE applicable, THE Demo SHALL highlight Amazon Bedrock AgentCore primitives usage
5. WHILE showing functionality, THE Demo SHALL demonstrate end-to-end agentic workflows

### Requirement 2: Four Separate Hackathon Projects

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant with four different project submissions, I want individual demo scripts for each project, so that I can submit them as separate entries to the AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MeetMind_Script SHALL showcase meeting intelligence and AI-powered summarization as standalone agent
2. THE Felicias_Finance_Script SHALL showcase financial services and crypto trading agent platform
3. THE Agent_Svea_Script SHALL showcase Swedish ERP integration and regulatory compliance agent
4. THE Happy_OS_Script SHALL showcase multi-agent operating system with resilience architecture
5. WHEN presenting each script, THE Demo SHALL be approximately 3 minutes in duration

### Requirement 3: Technical Architecture Demonstration

**User Story:** As a technical evaluator, I want to see the MCP architecture and agent isolation in action, so that I can assess the technical sophistication of the solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demonstrating agent communication, THE Demo SHALL show MCP protocol with reply-to semantics
2. WHEN showcasing resilience, THE Demo SHALL demonstrate circuit breaker failover between AWS and local services
3. WHEN showing agent isolation, THE Demo SHALL highlight zero backend.* imports in agent modules
4. WHERE relevant, THE Demo SHALL show fan-in logic collecting results from multiple agents
5. WHILE demonstrating workflows, THE Demo SHALL show async callbacks and result aggregation

### Requirement 4: Business Value and Impact

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to understand the real-world value and measurable impact of Happy OS, so that I can evaluate its commercial potential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Demo SHALL quantify uptime improvements (99.9% guarantee)
2. THE Demo SHALL demonstrate sub-5-second failover response times
3. THE Demo SHALL show cost savings through resilient architecture ($2.35M annual savings)
4. THE Demo SHALL highlight ROI metrics (1,567% ROI in Year 1)
5. THE Demo SHALL demonstrate real-world problem solving capabilities

### Requirement 5: AWS Service Integration

**User Story:** As an AWS solutions architect, I want to see comprehensive AWS service usage, so that I can validate the cloud-native approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN showing AI capabilities, THE Demo SHALL demonstrate AWS Bedrock Nova model usage
2. WHEN demonstrating data processing, THE Demo SHALL show integration with AWS services
3. WHERE applicable, THE Demo SHALL highlight Amazon Q integration for intelligent assistance
4. WHEN showcasing infrastructure, THE Demo SHALL demonstrate AWS-native deployment patterns
5. WHILE showing scalability, THE Demo SHALL highlight AWS service elasticity

### Requirement 6: Script Production Quality

**User Story:** As a content creator using NotebookLM, I want well-structured scripts with clear narration cues, so that I can generate professional demo videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Script SHALL include detailed scene descriptions and visual cues
2. THE Script SHALL provide natural dialogue for NotebookLM voice generation
3. THE Script SHALL include timing markers for 3-minute duration
4. THE Script SHALL specify technical demonstrations and screen recordings needed
5. THE Script SHALL include call-to-action and submission details
