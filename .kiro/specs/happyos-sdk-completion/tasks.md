## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Core Framework (Task 1) → Communication Layer (Task 2) → Security Framework (Task 3)
2. Observability (Task 4) and Resilience (Task 5) can be developed in parallel
3. Service Integration (Task 7) depends on Communication and Security
4. Industry Templates (Task 6) depend on Core Framework and Security
5. Distribution (Task 8) and Migration (Task 9) can start after core components
6. Testing (Task 10) runs continuously throughout development

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Tasks 4 (Observability) and 5 (Resilience) can be developed simultaneously
- Task 6 (Industry Templates) can be developed in parallel with Task 7 (Services)
- Task 8 (Distribution) and Task 9 (Migration) can be prepared in parallel
- Testing (Task 10) should run continuously for all completed components
