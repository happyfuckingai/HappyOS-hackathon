# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document focuses on the core requirements for agent system isolation, A2A protocol implementation, and AWS-native architecture. The primary goal is complete MCP server isolation with proper inter-agent communication and AWS service integration.

## Glossary

- **MCP_Server**: Isolated Model Context Protocol server with zero backend dependencies
- **A2A_Protocol**: Agent-to-Agent communication via MCP with reply-to semantics
- **Agent_Isolation**: Complete separation with no backend.* imports
- **Circuit_Breaker**: AWS service failover and resilience patterns
- **MCP_UI_Hub**: Central platform service for multi-tenant UI management
- **Reply_To_Semantics**: Async callback mechanism for MCP communication
- **AWS_Native**: Using AWS services (Bedrock, Lambda, DynamoDB) throughout
