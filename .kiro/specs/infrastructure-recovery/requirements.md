# Infrastructure Recovery Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for recovering and rebuilding the complete backend infrastructure that was accidentally deleted during hackathon cleanup. The system must restore full AWS-native capabilities with local fallback systems, multi-tenant architecture, and all agent communication protocols.

## Glossary

- **AWS Infrastructure**: Cloud-native services including Agent Core, OpenSearch, Lambda, API Gateway, ElastiCache
- **Local Fallback**: On-premises backup systems that activate when AWS services are unavailable
- **A2A Protocol**: Agent-to-Agent communication protocol with encryption and message routing
- **Multi-Tenant System**: Architecture supporting isolated tenants (MeetMind, Agent Svea, Felicia's Finance)
- **Circuit Breaker**: Pattern that detects failures and switches to fallback systems
- **Agent Core**: AWS service replacing mem0 for memory management and agent runtime
- **OpenSearch Service**: Managed search service with BM25+kNN hybrid search capabilities
- **Tenant Isolation**: Complete data separation between different tenant domains

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AWS Infrastructure Layer

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want a complete AWS infrastructure layer so that the system can leverage cloud-native services for scalability and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure, THE AWS Infrastructure Layer SHALL provision all required cloud services
2. WHILE managing resources, THE AWS Infrastructure Layer SHALL maintain tenant isolation across all services
3. IF service limits are reached, THEN THE AWS Infrastructure Layer SHALL implement auto-scaling policies
4. WHERE cost optimization is enabled, THE AWS Infrastructure Layer SHALL automatically scale down unused resources
5. THE AWS Infrastructure Layer SHALL include Infrastructure as Code (CDK/Terraform) for all services

### Requirement 2: Local Fallback Systems

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want local fallback systems so that the platform continues operating when AWS services are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS services become unavailable, THE Local Fallback System SHALL automatically activate within 5 seconds
2. WHILE operating in fallback mode, THE Local Fallback System SHALL maintain 80% of normal functionality
3. IF AWS services recover, THEN THE Local Fallback System SHALL seamlessly transition back to cloud mode
4. THE Local Fallback System SHALL include local memory, search, job execution, and file storage services
5. WHERE data synchronization is required, THE Local Fallback System SHALL queue operations for later sync

### Requirement 3: Agent Communication Infrastructure

**User Story:** As an agent developer, I want secure agent-to-agent communication so that different domain agents can collaborate safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents communicate, THE A2A Protocol SHALL encrypt all messages using RSA-2048
2. WHILE routing messages, THE A2A Protocol SHALL validate sender identity and permissions
3. IF message delivery fails, THEN THE A2A Protocol SHALL implement exponential backoff retry
4. WHERE cross-tenant communication occurs, THE A2A Protocol SHALL enforce strict access controls
5. THE A2A Protocol SHALL support both synchronous and asynchronous message patterns

### Requirement 4: Multi-Tenant Architecture

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want complete data isolation so that tenant data never leaks between domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing data, THE Multi-Tenant System SHALL use separate indices/tables per tenant
2. WHILE processing requests, THE Multi-Tenant System SHALL validate tenant scope for all operations
3. IF cross-tenant access is attempted, THEN THE Multi-Tenant System SHALL reject the request with 403 error
4. WHERE tenant configuration differs, THE Multi-Tenant System SHALL apply tenant-specific policies
5. THE Multi-Tenant System SHALL support tenants: MeetMind, Agent Svea, Felicia's Finance

### Requirement 5: Observability and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive observability so that I can monitor system health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system events occur, THE Observability System SHALL capture metrics, traces, and logs
2. WHILE monitoring performance, THE Observability System SHALL track latency, throughput, and error rates
3. IF anomalies are detected, THEN THE Observability System SHALL trigger alerts and circuit breakers
4. WHERE debugging is needed, THE Observability System SHALL provide distributed tracing across services
5. THE Observability System SHALL export data to CloudWatch, OpenTelemetry, and local exporters

### Requirement 6: Service Layer Architecture

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want a clean service layer so that business logic is separated from infrastructure concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing cloud services, THE Service Layer SHALL provide unified interfaces for AWS and local implementations
2. WHILE handling requests, THE Service Layer SHALL implement retry policies and circuit breaker patterns
3. IF service dependencies fail, THEN THE Service Layer SHALL gracefully degrade functionality
4. WHERE caching is beneficial, THE Service Layer SHALL implement multi-level caching strategies
5. THE Service Layer SHALL include services for: AgentCore, OpenSearch, Lambda, Gateway, Cache, S3, Secrets, Identity, EventBridge, Queue, Telemetry, Health, Cost Optimization

### Requirement 7: Domain Agent Systems

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want isolated agent systems so that each business domain can operate independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing domain requests, THE Domain Agent System SHALL operate within tenant boundaries
2. WHILE communicating with other agents, THE Domain Agent System SHALL use the A2A protocol
3. IF domain-specific logic is needed, THEN THE Domain Agent System SHALL implement custom business rules
4. WHERE data schemas differ, THE Domain Agent System SHALL validate against domain-specific schemas
5. THE Domain Agent System SHALL support domains: MeetMind (summarization), Agent Svea (government docs), Felicia's Finance (ledger analytics)

### Requirement 8: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want comprehensive security controls so that the system meets enterprise security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling authentication, THE Security System SHALL implement RBAC and ABAC policies
2. WHILE managing secrets, THE Security System SHALL use encrypted key storage and rotation
3. IF unauthorized access is attempted, THEN THE Security System SHALL log and block the attempt
4. WHERE audit trails are required, THE Security System SHALL maintain comprehensive audit logs
5. THE Security System SHALL include authorization, keyring management, token handling, and audit capabilities

### Requirement 9: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want centralized configuration so that system behavior can be controlled without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading configuration, THE Configuration System SHALL support environment-specific settings
2. WHILE managing tenants, THE Configuration System SHALL load tenant-specific configurations
3. IF feature flags change, THEN THE Configuration System SHALL apply changes without restart
4. WHERE policies are defined, THE Configuration System SHALL enforce orchestration and retrieval policies
5. THE Configuration System SHALL include settings, tenant maps, policy definitions, and feature toggles

### Requirement 10: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want comprehensive testing so that system reliability can be validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests, THE Testing System SHALL validate A2A protocol functionality
2. WHILE testing resilience, THE Testing System SHALL simulate AWS service failures
3. IF tenant isolation is tested, THEN THE Testing System SHALL verify no data leakage occurs
4. WHERE fallback scenarios are tested, THE Testing System SHALL demonstrate seamless transitions
5. THE Testing System SHALL include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end demo scenarios
