# AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon - Focus Areas

## Core Requirements for HappyOS Multi-Agent System

### 1. Agent System Isolation (CRITICAL)
- **Complete MCP Server Isolation**: Each agent (MeetMind, Agent Svea, Felicia's Finance) runs as standalone MCP server
- **Zero Backend Dependencies**: NO `backend.*` imports in agent code
- **A2A Protocol Communication**: All inter-agent communication via MCP with reply-to semantics
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Proper tenant isolation with signed headers

### 2. AWS-Native Implementation (REQUIRED)
- **Amazon Bedrock**: LLM hosting for all AI capabilities
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless agent execution
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Multi-tenant data storage
- **AWS API Gateway**: MCP server endpoints
- **Amazon ElastiCache**: Redis for A2A message queuing
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and observability

### 3. Technical Execution Priorities (50% of judging)
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Proper tool registration and execution
- **Circuit Breaker Patterns**: AWS service failover mechanisms  
- **Fan-In Logic**: MeetMind collects results from multiple agents
- **Reply-To Semantics**: Async callback handling
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CDK deployment

### 4. System Architecture Requirements
- **MCP UI Hub**: Central platform service for multi-tenant UI management
- **Communications Agent**: LiveKit + Google Realtime orchestration
- **Agent Registry**: Standardized MCP server discovery
- **Signed Authentication**: HMAC/Ed25519 for MCP headers

### 5. Demonstration Requirements
- **End-to-End Agentic Workflow**: Show complete multi-agent interaction
- **Real-Time Communication**: LiveKit integration with MCP workflows
- **Multi-Tenant UI**: Different tenant configurations and themes
- **Circuit Breaker Demo**: AWS service failover in action
- **A2A Message Flow**: Trace messages between isolated agents

### 6. Key Success Metrics
- **Agent Isolation**: Zero cross-dependencies between agent modules
- **AWS Integration**: Native use of AWS services throughout
- **Scalability**: Multi-tenant architecture with proper isolation
- **Resilience**: Circuit breaker patterns and failover mechanisms
- **Performance**: Sub-5-second response times for agent interactions

## Focus Areas (DO NOT OVERCOMPLICATE)
1. ✅ **Agent Isolation**: Complete MCP server separation
2. ✅ **A2A Protocol**: Proper inter-agent communication
3. ✅ **AWS Native**: Use AWS services throughout
4. ✅ **MCP UI Hub**: Central platform for results display
5. ❌ **Complex Workflows**: Keep it simple, focus on core functionality
