# Product Overview

Happy OS is a self-healing multi-agent operating system designed for AI agents with built-in resilience and autonomous recovery capabilities. The system demonstrates the future of resilient AI platforms by providing zero-downtime operations and maintaining 80% functionality during cloud outages through MCP-based one-way communication architecture.

## Core Components - Isolated MCP Servers

- **MeetMind MCP Server**: Multi-user meeting management with AI-powered summarization and fan-in logic for collecting partial results from other agents
- **Agent Svea MCP Server**: Swedish regulatory compliance and ERP integration agent operating as standalone MCP server
- **Felicia's Finance MCP Server**: Financial services and crypto trading agent platform with complete GCP-to-AWS migration
- **Communications Agent**: Orchestration layer using LiveKit + Google Realtime that initiates MCP workflows with reply-to semantics

## Key Features - MCP Architecture

- **Complete Agent Isolation**: Each agent operates as standalone MCP server with zero backend.* imports
- **One-Way Communication**: MCP protocol with "reply-to" semantics for async callbacks between agents
- **Fan-In Logic**: MeetMind collects partial results from multiple agents and combines them intelligently
- **Circuit Breaker Resilience**: Automatic failover between AWS and local services via circuit breaker patterns
- **Hybrid Cloud-Local Architecture**: Maximum uptime through intelligent fallback systems
- **LiveKit Integration**: Real-time video/audio communication integrated with MCP workflow orchestration
- **Signed Authentication**: Multi-tenant security enforced via MCP headers with HMAC/Ed25519 signatures

## Business Value

- **99.9% uptime guarantee** through MCP-based intelligent fallback systems
- **Sub-5-second failover** response to service outages via circuit breakers
- **Complete Module Independence**: Deploy, scale, and maintain agents independently
- **$2.35M annual savings** in downtime costs through resilient architecture
- **1,567% ROI in Year 1** with 1.8-month payback period
