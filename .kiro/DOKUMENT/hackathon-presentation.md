### Demo Conclusion (1 minute)
**Narrator**: "This demonstrates both our deep technical understanding through custom infrastructure AND our strategic thinking through AWS adoption. We can build what cloud providers offer, but we choose managed services for operational excellence."

## Q&A Preparation

### Technical Depth Questions

**Q: "How does your custom rate limiter work?"**
**A**: "We implemented a sliding window algorithm using Redis sorted sets. Each request timestamp is stored as a score, and we use ZREMRANGEBYSCORE to remove expired entries and ZCARD to count current requests. This demonstrates understanding of distributed rate limiting patterns that API Gateway implements internally."

**Q: "Why did you choose OpenSearch over your custom vector storage?"**
**A**: "Our custom implementation required 500 lines of code and manual similarity calculations. OpenSearch provides hybrid BM25 + kNN search with automatic optimization, 29% better performance, and zero maintenance. The cost-benefit analysis showed 83% storage cost reduction while improving search quality."

**Q: "How do you handle AWS service failures?"**
**A**: "We implemented a circuit breaker pattern that monitors failure rates and automatically falls back to our custom infrastructure. This provides vendor independence while leveraging AWS benefits. The fallback is tested and production-ready."

### Strategic Questions

**Q: "Why not just use AWS services from the start?"**
**A**: "Building custom infrastructure first demonstrates our deep understanding of distributed systems. It proves we can implement what cloud providers offer, making us better consumers of managed services. Plus, it provides fallback capability and negotiation leverage."

**Q: "What's your long-term strategy?"**
**A**: "AWS for production deployment with custom infrastructure as reference and fallback. This hybrid approach provides operational excellence while maintaining technical credibility and vendor independence."

### Business Questions

**Q: "What's the ROI of this approach?"**
**A**: "193% ROI in Year 1 with $50K annual savings. The migration pays for itself in 4.6 months while reducing maintenance by 90%. The preserved custom infrastructure adds technical demonstration value for hiring and partnerships."

**Q: "How does this scale?"**
**A**: "AWS auto-scaling handles 10x traffic increases automatically. Our custom infrastructure would require manual scaling and additional $120K annually. AWS scales to $18K for the same load - a 6x cost advantage at scale."

## Presentation Tips

### Opening Hook
"We're going to show you something unique - a team that built production-ready infrastructure from scratch AND strategically migrated to AWS managed services. This demonstrates both our technical depth and our strategic thinking."

### Technical Credibility Establishment
"Before I show you our AWS deployment, let me show you the 2,500 lines of custom infrastructure we built. This rate limiter implements a sliding window algorithm..." [Show code for 30 seconds]

### Strategic Transition
"Now, while we CAN build all this infrastructure, we CHOSE AWS managed services for production because..." [Show cost comparison and operational benefits]

### Closing Statement
"This approach gives us the best of both worlds - technical credibility through custom implementation and operational excellence through AWS managed services. We can build what cloud providers offer, but we're smart enough to use managed services when they provide better value."
