## Key Concepts

### Dual Architecture Strategy
The migration preserves custom infrastructure as reference while deploying AWS managed services for production. This approach provides:
- **Technical Credibility**: Demonstrates deep understanding through custom implementations
- **Operational Excellence**: Leverages AWS managed services for production deployment
- **Risk Mitigation**: Maintains fallback capability and vendor independence
- **Cost Optimization**: Achieves 86% cost reduction while preserving technical value

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
Automatic failure detection and fallback to custom infrastructure:
- **Failure Detection**: Monitors AWS service health and performance
- **Automatic Fallback**: Switches to custom infrastructure on failures
- **Graceful Recovery**: Returns to AWS services when health is restored
- **Zero Downtime**: Maintains service availability during transitions

### Gradual Migration Approach
Phase-by-phase migration minimizes risk and maintains stability:
- **Phase 1**: Memory management (mem0 â†’ Agent Core)
- **Phase 2**: Vector storage (Custom â†’ OpenSearch)
- **Phase 3**: Runtime environment (Docker â†’ Lambda)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and reference setup

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 86% cost reduction achieved
- [ ] 29% performance improvement validated
