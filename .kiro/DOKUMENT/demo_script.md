"Now let's see the complete integration - from user input to personalized response."

**Live Interaction:**
```bash
# Terminal 2: Simulate user interaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "marcus",
    "message": "What are the benefits of our AWS migration?",
    "session_id": "demo-session"
  }'
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔗 DEMO 4: Complete Integration Flow
🎯 Simulating end-to-end user interaction...

User Message: Marcus asks about AWS migration benefits
Agent Core: Retrieves Marcus's technical context
OpenSearch: Searches historical migration discussions  
Lambda Agent: Processes request with full context
Response: Personalized response with technical depth

✅ Complete AWS integration working seamlessly!
🔄 Preserved Components:
  • A2A Protocol: Agent communication unchanged
  • ADK Framework: Agent lifecycle management intact
  • MCP UI Hub: Enhanced for AWS integration
```

**Narration:**
"Marcus gets a technical response because Agent Core remembers his programming background. The system searched our historical discussions and provided personalized context."

---

### Demo 5: Failure Scenario & Fallback (60 seconds)

**Setup:**
"Finally, let's see what happens when AWS services fail."

**Live Commands:**
```bash
# Terminal 3: Simulate AWS failure
python failure_demo.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚨 FAILURE SCENARIOS & FALLBACK MECHANISMS
☁️ SCENARIO 1: AWS Service Failure

🔄 Simulating normal AWS operations...
✅ Agent Core Memory: store_user_context - SUCCESS
✅ OpenSearch Query: semantic_search - SUCCESS
✅ Lambda Invocation: process_request - SUCCESS

🚨 SIMULATING AWS SERVICE OUTAGE...

❌ AWS Agent Core FAILURE: ServiceUnavailableException
🔄 Activating fallback: mem0 local memory
✅ Fallback active - Minimal impact, seamless fallback

❌ OpenSearch FAILURE: ClusterUnavailableException
🔄 Activating fallback: Cache-based search
✅ Fallback active - Reduced search quality, maintained functionality

🚨 Circuit breaker OPENED (failures: 3)
🔄 Using fallback for remaining requests
✅ System remains functional with custom infrastructure
```

**Key Points:**
- "Circuit breaker opens after 3 failures"
- "Automatic fallback to custom infrastructure"
- "System remains functional during AWS outages"

---

## Technical Code Walkthrough (During Demo)

### Show Custom Infrastructure Code
```bash
# Terminal 4: Show custom code complexity
cd ../../../../backend/services/infrastructure
ls -la
wc -l *.py
```

**Narration:**
"Here's our custom infrastructure - 2,389 lines of production-ready code. Let me show you the rate limiter implementation..."

```bash
head -50 rate_limiter.py
```

**Key Points:**
- "Sliding window algorithm with O(log N) complexity"
- "Circuit breaker integration for resilience"
- "This demonstrates our deep systems knowledge"

### Show AWS Integration Code
```bash
cd ../aws
ls -la
head -30 agent_core.py
```

**Narration:**
"And here's our AWS integration - clean, simple, leveraging managed services instead of custom implementation."

---

## Demo Troubleshooting

### If AWS Demo Fails
**Fallback Plan:**
1. "This actually demonstrates our circuit breaker in action!"
2. Switch to custom infrastructure demo
3. Show how system remains functional
4. Explain this is exactly why we built fallback capabilities

### If Custom Infrastructure Demo Fails
**Recovery:**
1. Show the code files directly
2. Explain the architecture from slides
3. Reference the 2,389 lines of code
4. Focus on AWS benefits for production

### If Network Issues
**Backup Plan:**
1. Use pre-recorded demo video
2. Show static code examples
3. Walk through architecture diagrams
4. Focus on Q&A and technical discussion
