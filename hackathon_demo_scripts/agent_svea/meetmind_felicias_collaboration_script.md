# MeetMind & Felicia's Finance Collaboration Demo Script: Meeting Intelligence with Financial Decision-Making

**Duration:** 3 minutes  
**Target:** AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon Submission  
**Focus:** Meeting Productivity and Real-Time Financial Decision-Making

---

## Opening Hook: The Meeting-to-Decision Gap (0:00-0:20)

### Scene 1: The $47 Billion Meeting Productivity Crisis (0:00-0:10)

**[Visual: Corporate boardroom with executives in a heated financial discussion, multiple screens showing conflicting data, and visible frustration as decisions stall]**

**Narrator:** "It's 3 PM on a Wednesday. The executive team at TechCorp has been in this financial planning meeting for 2 hours, discussing a critical $15 million investment decision. They have market data, financial projections, and regulatory requirements - but extracting actionable insights from this discussion feels impossible.

**[Visual: Statistics overlay showing meeting inefficiency costs - $47 billion annually in lost productivity, 67% of executives report meetings don't lead to clear decisions]**

American businesses lose $47 billion annually to unproductive meetings. The average executive spends 37% of their time in meetings, but only 25% of those meetings result in clear, actionable decisions. For financial decisions specifically, the gap between discussion and action costs companies an average of $2.3 million per year in delayed opportunities and missed market timing."

### Scene 2: MeetMind & Felicia's Finance Collaboration Introduction (0:10-0:20)

**[Visual: Split screen showing MeetMind's meeting intelligence interface connected to Felicia's Finance trading dashboard, with real-time data flowing between them]**

**Narrator:** "Meet the solution: MeetMind and Felicia's Finance working together as collaborative AI agents. MeetMind doesn't just transcribe meetings - it extracts financial insights and automatically coordinates with Felicia's Finance to provide real-time market analysis, risk assessment, and investment recommendations.

**[Visual: Animated workflow showing meeting audio → MeetMind analysis → Felicia's Finance financial modeling → actionable recommendations back to meeting participants]**

This isn't just meeting intelligence - it's intelligent financial decision-making. While executives discuss strategy, MeetMind and Felicia's Finance collaborate autonomously to analyze market conditions, validate financial assumptions, and present data-driven recommendations in real-time. The result? Meetings that end with clear, financially-validated decisions instead of endless follow-up tasks."

Technical Demonstration: Real-Time Meeting Intelligence with Financial Analysis (0:20-2:20)

### Scene 3: LiveKit Integration with AWS Bedrock Nova (0:20-0:50)

**[Visual: Live demo - MeetMind dashboard showing active meeting with real-time transcription and financial keyword detection]**

**Narrator:** "Let's see this collaboration in action. Here's a live executive meeting where MeetMind is processing audio through LiveKit's real-time communication platform, integrated with AWS Bedrock Nova for intelligent financial analysis."

**[Visual: Code snippet showing LiveKit integration with AWS Bedrock Nova for meeting intelligence]**

"Watch MeetMind's sophisticated real-time processing - it's not just transcribing the meeting, it's autonomously identifying financial decision points, extracting key data like investment amounts, market conditions, and risk factors. When executives mention '$15 million Series B funding' or 'Q4 revenue projections,' MeetMind immediately recognizes these as financial analysis opportunities."

### Scene 4: Amazon Q Integration for Intelligent Financial Assistance (0:50-1:20)

**[Visual: Amazon Q interface integrated within the meeting dashboard, providing real-time financial insights and recommendations]**

**Narrator:** "Here's where Amazon Q transforms meeting intelligence into actionable financial guidance. As MeetMind processes the discussion, Amazon Q provides intelligent assistance with market data, financial calculations, and strategic recommendations."

**[Visual: Live demo showing Amazon Q responding to financial queries extracted from meeting content]**

**[Screen recording shows real-time Amazon Q integration:]**
- Meeting Discussion: "Should we invest $15M in the European expansion?"
- MeetMind Extraction: Investment amount, geographic focus, strategic context
- Amazon Q Analysis: PROCESSING → MARKET_DATA_RETRIEVED → ANALYSIS_COMPLETE
- Intelligent Response: "European SaaS market growing 23% annually, competitive landscape analysis, ROI projections"
- Financial Recommendation: "Recommended investment: $12M phased over 18 months"

"The remarkable integration allows Amazon Q to provide contextual financial intelligence without interrupting the meeting flow. Participants receive relevant market data, competitive analysis, and financial projections directly related to their discussion - all processed and delivered autonomously."

### Scene 5: Real-Time Audio/Video Processing with AWS Integration (1:20-1:50)

**[Visual: Technical architecture diagram showing LiveKit audio/video streams being processed through AWS services]**

**Narrator:** "MeetMind's real-time processing capabilities leverage the full AWS ecosystem for comprehensive meeting intelligence. Watch as audio and video streams are processed simultaneously for maximum insight extraction."

**[Visual: Live technical demonstration showing multi-modal processing]**

**AWS-Integrated Real-Time Processing:**
- **Audio Processing:** LiveKit → AWS Transcribe → Bedrock Nova for content analysis
- **Video Analysis:** LiveKit video → Amazon Rekognition for participant engagement
- **Document Recognition:** Screen sharing → Amazon Textract for financial document analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Amazon Comprehend for meeting tone and decision confidence
- **Real-Time Storage:** Amazon DynamoDB for meeting context and decision history

"This comprehensive AWS integration enables MeetMind to understand not just what's being said, but how it's being received, what documents are being referenced, and the overall effectiveness of the financial decision-making process. It's meeting intelligence powered by the full AWS AI ecosystem."

### Scene 6: Fan-In Logic with Cross-Agent Financial Workflow (1:50-2:20)

**[Visual: System architecture diagram showing MeetMind at the center, collecting results from multiple agents via MCP protocol]**

**Narrator:** "Now here's where MeetMind's fan-in logic demonstrates true multi-agent intelligence. Watch as MeetMind autonomously coordinates with Felicia's Finance, Agent Svea, and other specialized agents to provide comprehensive financial decision support."

**[Visual: Live demo showing MeetMind collecting partial results from multiple agents asynchronously]**

**[Screen recording shows real-time fan-in coordination:]**
- Meeting Context: "$15M European expansion discussion"
- MeetMind Request to Felicia's Finance: Market analysis and risk assessment
- MeetMind Request to Agent Svea: Regulatory compliance for EU operations  
- MeetMind Request to Communications Agent: Stakeholder impact analysis
- Fan-In Collection: GATHERING → PARTIAL_RESULTS → SYNTHESIS → COMPLETE

**[Visual: Precise timing showing async result collection: Results arriving at 2.1s, 3.7s, and 4.2s]**

"Watch MeetMind's sophisticated fan-in logic in action. As results arrive asynchronously from different agents, MeetMind doesn't wait for all responses - it intelligently integrates partial results and updates recommendations in real-time. Felicia's Finance provides market analysis in 2.1 seconds, Agent Svea delivers compliance insights in 3.7 seconds, and the Communications Agent adds stakeholder analysis in 4.2 seconds."
