- [x] Autonomous decision-making examples defined
- [x] API/database/external tool integration mapped
- [x] End-to-end agentic workflow patterns established
- [x] Architecture diagram requirements specified
- [x] Public repository reference framework created

## Production Readiness
- [x] NotebookLM compatibility guidelines established
- [x] 3-minute duration framework implemented
- [x] Visual asset specifications defined
- [x] Screen recording coordination planned
- [x] Quality assurance standards documented

## Requirements Mapping

### Requirement 1.1: Hackathon Compliance Coverage
- [x] AWS Bedrock/SageMaker usage framework established
- [x] Autonomous decision-making patterns defined
- [x] Integration examples documented across all scripts

### Requirement 6.1: Script Production Quality
- [x] Detailed scene descriptions and visual cues framework
- [x] Natural dialogue structure for NotebookLM
- [x] Timing markers for 3-minute duration
- [x] Technical demonstration coordination planned

### Requirement 6.3: NotebookLM Production Package
- [x] NotebookLM-compatible formatting guidelines

## Next Phase Readiness
The foundation is complete and ready for:
1. Individual script development using shared templates
2. Visual asset creation per established guidelines
3. NotebookLM script formatting and testing
4. Production coordination and quality assurance

All shared components are properly integrated and cross-referenced, providing a consistent foundation for developing the four distinct hackathon demo scripts.
